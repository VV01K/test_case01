# Introduction
This project is here to see how we could improve a code base.

# Instructions 
Here are some instructions to follow if you want to practice.

## Steps
- Launch the program and understand what it supposed to do
- Find and fix the problem
- Make the error more explicit
- Run the tests
- The 8 of march the test passed. Why the test fails today ?
- Write a more explicit test ; we want the program to send (not a real mail) an email to Benoit
- What other tests could you write ?
- Make sure that the whole employees file is parsed
- Write a test to verify that Bill will receive his Greetings
- How can you improve the SendGreetings method in term of readability ?
- What responsibility can be moved out ? To Whom ?

This code is based on the C# [kata birthday-greetings](https://github.com/artisan-developpeur/birthday-greeting)
